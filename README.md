GitHub User Finder is a React-based web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and view/navigate to public repositories.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was developed for a 3-day assignment, and I'm in my first year of undergrad CS. It's not a full-fledged product or anything that serious. The purpose of the project was to explore API integration, virtual DOM manipulation, learning React, Axios, etc., and web development in general.
